# Community-Discussion
This is the repo for community discussions. Go to the discussions tab in this repo, and there you can create a discussion, or just comment on an already there discussion.

## Subscribe
There will be a discussion which is the basic one for community announcments. Go to that discussion, scroll down, and hit the button which says subscribe. The button will be on the right side. This is so you can get notifications on all the posts on this discussion. ![Just a pic to help you](https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1608101089934_0a00f6c73d21abef2eab2e08dd98d204.png)

## Fun
You can use these discussions just for fun and you can post random stuff(not bad stuff or I can remove your access to this repo). You can have random comedy, such. People who help a lot by warning people not to post these kind of thing or those kind of thing might get promoted to the maintainer of the discussions so try to be as helpful as possible(ahap). You can also ask coding questions here, though this organization is for repl.it and in repl.it there is a [talk section](https://repl.it/talk/all) in which you can ask questions. I recommend that instead of this for coding based questions.

### Code
This repo is not for code so do not add code here.
